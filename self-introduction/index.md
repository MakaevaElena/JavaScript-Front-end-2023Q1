Hi! My name is Helen.

I am a frontend developer.

I graduated from the Automatic Telecommunications Faculty of the Siberian State University of Telecommunications and Information Science.
I worked as a network administrator at the Avantel telecom company for a few years after the graduation. I successfully set up a network equipment, was an administrator of the Voice over IP technology .

Then, I had a rather big interruption in my IT-activities. For family reasons I worked in China as a foreign trade specialist for six years.
But, I dreamed to come back to IT. I began to study web technologies with part-time employment four years ago.

I specialized as WordPress developer for first two years and successfully implemented several WordPress projects for clients I found on my own.

Then, I decided to go into the coding deeply and took few front-end courses at HTML Academy, Udemy, It-Step School and I’m studing in Rolling Scopes - School now.

During my studies, I made many project such as real estate rental, travel tour planning, pizza delivery, animal shelter site, virtual-keyboard, minesweeper game, where I used the stack I learned – Javascript, TypeScript, React, Redux, OOP, Rest API , GitHub, PixelPerfect, Sass and responsive layout from Figma.

I also studied Node JS and testing with Jest.

My nearest plan is to make a complex full-stack project that includes all the technologies that I know.

I love being in a team with people who think logically and technically.
I do my work responsibly, meet the deadlines, check the project specification in detail and carefully follow the recommendations.

I am a cheerful person, in my free time I go in for sports and dancing, watch films in English with my lovely two children.
Web development constantly surprises with new approaches, new ideas, it will never be boring!

No crisis will change my choice at all, this is the work that I will do in any case, as work is a big part of life, and I want to spend it with interest!

Thanks for your attention!
Buy!
